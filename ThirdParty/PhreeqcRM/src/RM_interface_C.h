@a N sets of component concentrations are converted to SOLUTIONs numbered 1-@a n in the Utility IPhreeqc.
The solutions can be reacted and manipulated with the methods of IPhreeqc. If solution concentration units
(@ref RM_SetUnitsSolution) are per liter, one liter of solution is created in the Utility instance; if solution
concentration units are mass fraction, one kilogram of solution is created in the Utility instance.
The motivation for this

(pH for example) or react the mixture to form scale minerals. The code fragments below make a mixture of
concentrations and then calculate the pH of the mixture.

/**
Transfer solutions and reactants from the InitialPhreeqc instance to the reaction-module workers, possibly with mixing.
In its simplest form, @a initial_conditions1 is used to select initial conditions, including solutions and reactants,
for each cell of the model, without mixing.
@a Initial_conditions1 is dimensioned (@a nxyz, 7), where @a nxyz is the number of grid cells in the user's model
(@ref RM_GetGridCellCount). The dimension of 7 refers to solutions and reactants in the following order:
(1) SOLUTIONS, (2) EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES, (3) EXCHANGE, (4) SURFACE, (5) GAS_PHASE,
(6) SOLID_SOLUTIONS, and (7) KINETICS. In C, initial_solution1[3*nxyz + 99] = 2, indicates that
cell 99 (0 based) contains the SURFACE definition with user number 2 that has been defined in the
InitialPhreeqc instance (either by @ref RM_RunFile or @ref RM_RunString).
@n@n
It is also possible to mix solutions and reactants to obtain the initial conditions for cells. For mixing,
@a initials_conditions2 contains numbers for a second entity that mixes with the entity defined in @a initial_conditions1.
@a Fraction1 contains the mixing fraction for @a initial_conditions1, whereas (1 - @a fraction1) is the mixing fraction for
@a initial_conditions2.
In C, initial_solution1[3*nxyz + 99] = 2, initial_solution2[3*nxyz + 99] = 3,
fraction1[3*nxyz + 99] = 0.25 indicates that
cell 99 (0 based) contains a mixture of 0.25 SURFACE 2 and 0.75 SURFACE 3, where the surface compositions have been defined in the
InitialPhreeqc instance. If the user number in @a initial_conditions2 is negative, no mixing occurs.
If @a initials_conditions2 and @a fraction1 are NULL,
no mixing is used, and initial conditions are derived solely from @a initials_conditions1.

@param initial_conditions1 Array of solution and reactant index numbers that refer to definitions in the InitialPhreeqc instance.
Size is (@a nxyz,7). The order of definitions is given above.
Negative values are ignored, resulting in no definition of that entity for that cell.
@param initial_conditions2  Array of solution and reactant index numbers that refer to definitions in the InitialPhreeqc instance.
Nonnegative values of @a initial_conditions2 result in mixing with the entities defined in @a initial_conditions1.
Negative values result in no mixing.
Size is (@a nxyz,7). The order of definitions is given above.
May be NULL in C; setting to NULL results in no mixing.
@param fraction1           Fraction of initial_conditions1 that mixes with (1-@a fraction1) of initial_conditions2.

MPI only. Defines a callback function that allows additional tasks to be done
by the workers. The method @ref RM_MpiWorker contains a loop,
where the workers receive a message (an integer),
run a function corresponding to that integer,
and then wait for another message.
RM_SetMpiWorkerCallback allows the developer to add another function
that responds to additional integer messages by calling developer-defined functions
corresponding to those integers.
@ref RM_MpiWorker calls the callback function when the message number
is not one of the PhreeqcRM message numbers.
Messages are unique integer numbers. PhreeqcRM uses integers in a range
beginning at 0. It is suggested that developers use message numbers starting
at 1000 or higher for their tasks.
The callback function calls a developer-defined function specified
by the message number and then returns to @ref RM_MpiWorker to wait for
another message.
@n@n
In C, an additional pointer can be supplied to find the data necessary to do the task.
A void pointer may be set with @ref RM_SetMpiWorkerCallbackCookie. This pointer
is passed to the callback function through a void pointer argument in addition
to the integer message argument. The void pointer may be a pointer to a struct that
contains pointers to additional data. @ref RM_SetMpiWorkerCallbackCookie
must be called by each worker before @ref RM_MpiWorker is called.
@n@n
The motivation for this method is to allow the workers to perform other
tasks, for instance, parallel transport calculations, within the structure
of @ref RM_MpiWorker. The callback function
can be used to allow the workers to receive data, perform transport calculations,
and (or) send results, without leaving the loop of @ref RM_MpiWorker. Alternatively,
it is possible for the workers to return from @ref RM_MpiWorker
by a call to @ref RM_MpiWorkerBreak by root. The workers could then call
subroutines to receive data, calculate transport, and send data,
and then resume processing PhreeqcRM messages from root with another
call to @ref RM_MpiWorker.
@param id               The instance @a id returned from @ref RM_Create.

Sets the property for partitioning solids between the saturated and unsaturated

The option is intended to be used by saturated-only
flow codes that allow a variable water table.
The value has meaning only when saturations

If a cell has a saturation of 0.5, then
the water interacts with only half of the solids and gases; the other half is unreactive
until the water table rises. As the saturation in a cell varies,
solids and gases are transferred between the

The methods are similar, but limited testing indicates the default method performs better.

The numerical method of PHREEQC is more robust if the water volume for a reaction cell is

Small water volumes caused by small porosities and (or) small saturations (and (or) small representative volumes)
may cause non-convergence of the numerical method.

/**
Set input units for surfaces.
In PHREEQC input, surfaces are defined by moles of surface sites (@a Mp).
@a RM_SetUnitsSurface specifies how the number of moles of surface sites in a reaction cell (@a Mc)
is calculated from the input value (@a Mp).

Options are
0, @a Mp is mol/L of RV (default),    @a Mc = @a Mp*RV, where RV is the representative volume (@ref RM_SetRepresentativeVolume);
1, @a Mp is mol/L of water in the RV, @a Mc = @a Mp*P*RV, where @a P is porosity (@ref RM_SetPorosity); or
2, @a Mp is mol/L of rock in the RV,  @a Mc = @a Mp*(1-@a P)*RV.

If a single SURFACE definition is used for cells with different initial porosity, 
   the three options scale quite differently. 
For option 0, the number of moles of surface sites will be the same regardless of porosity. 
For option 1, the number of moles of surface sites will be vary directly with porosity and inversely with rock volume. 
For option 2, the number of moles of surface sites will vary directly with rock volume and inversely with porosity.

/**
Determines the volume and density to use when converting from the reaction-module concentrations
to transport concentrations (@ref RM_GetConcentrations).
Two options are available to convert concentration units:
(1) the density and solution volume calculated by PHREEQC are used, or
(2) the specified density (@ref RM_SetDensity)
and solution volume are defined by the product of
saturation (@ref RM_SetSaturation), porosity (@ref RM_SetPorosity),
and representative volume (@ref RM_SetRepresentativeVolume).
Transport models that consider density-dependent flow will probably use the
PHREEQC-calculated density and solution volume (default),
whereas transport models that assume constant-density flow will probably use
specified values of density and solution volume.
Only the following databases distributed with PhreeqcRM have molar volume information
needed to accurately calculate density and solution volume: phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat.
Density is only used when converting to transport units of mass fraction.

@param id               The instance @a id returned from @ref RM_Create.
@param tf               @a True indicates that the solution density and volume as
calculated by PHREEQC will be used to calculate concentrations.
@a False indicates that the solution density set by @ref RM_SetDensity and the volume determined by the
product of  @ref RM_SetSaturation, @ref RM_SetPorosity, and @ref RM_SetRepresentativeVolume,
will be used to calculate concentrations retrieved by @ref RM_GetConcentrations.
