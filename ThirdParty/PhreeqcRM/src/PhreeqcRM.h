Constructor for the PhreeqcRM reaction module. If the code is compiled with
the preprocessor directive USE_OPENMP, the reaction module use OPENMP and multiple threads.
If the code is compiled with the preprocessor directive USE_MPI, the reaction
module will use MPI and multiple processes. If neither preprocessor directive is used,
the reaction module will be serial (unparallelized).
@param nxyz        The number of grid cells in the users model.
@param thread_count_or_communicator If multithreaded, the number of threads to use
in parallel segments of the code.
If @a thread_count_or_communicator is <= 0, the number of threads is set equal to the number of processors in the computer.
If multiprocessor, the MPI communicator to use within the reaction module.
@param io        Optionally, a PHRQ_io input/output object can be provided to the constructor. By default
a PHRQ_io object is constructed to handle reading and writing files.

This method can be called multiple times and the list that is created is cummulative.
The list is the set of components that needs to be transported. By default the list

alternatively, the list may be set to contain total H and total O (@ref SetComponentH2O),

/**
Transfer solutions and reactants from the InitialPhreeqc instance to the reaction-module workers, possibly with mixing.
In its simplest form, @a  initial_conditions1 is used to select initial conditions, including solutions and reactants,
for each cell of the model, without mixing.
@a Initial_conditions1 is dimensioned 7 times @a  nxyz, where @a  nxyz is the number of grid cells in the user's model
(@ref GetGridCellCount). The dimension of 7 refers to solutions and reactants in the following order:
(0) SOLUTIONS, (1) EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES, (2) EXCHANGE, (3) SURFACE, (4) GAS_PHASE,
(5) SOLID_SOLUTIONS, and (6) KINETICS.
The definition initial_solution1[3*nxyz + 99] = 2, indicates that
cell 99 (0 based) contains the SURFACE definition (index 3) defined by SURFACE 2 in the InitialPhreeqc instance
(either by @ref RunFile or @ref RunString).
@n@n
It is also possible to mix solutions and reactants to obtain the initial conditions for cells. For mixing,
@a initials_conditions2 contains numbers for a second entity that mixes with the entity defined in @a initial_conditions1.
@a Fraction1 contains the mixing fraction for @a initial_conditions1,
whereas (1 - @a fraction1) is the mixing fraction for @a initial_conditions2.
The definitions initial_solution1[3*nxyz + 99] = 2, initial_solution2[3*nxyz + 99] = 3,
fraction1[3*nxyz + 99] = 0.25 indicates that
cell 99 (0 based) contains a mixture of 0.25 SURFACE 2 and 0.75 SURFACE 3,
where the surface compositions have been defined in the InitialPhreeqc instance.
If the user number in @a initial_conditions2 is negative, no mixing occurs.
@param initial_conditions1 Vector of solution and reactant index numbers that refer to
definitions in the InitialPhreeqc instance.
Size is 7 times @a nxyz, where @a nxyz is the number of grid cells in the user's model (@ref GetGridCellCount).

Negative values are ignored, resulting in no definition of that entity for that cell.
@param initial_conditions2  Vector of solution and reactant index numbers that refer to
definitions in the InitialPhreeqc instance.
Nonnegative values of @a initial_conditions2 result in mixing with the entities defined in @a initial_conditions1.
Negative values result in no mixing.

MPI and C/C++ only. Defines a callback function that allows additional tasks to be done
by the workers. The method @ref MpiWorker contains a loop,
where the workers receive a message (an integer),
run a function corresponding to that integer,
and then wait for another message.
SetMpiWorkerCallbackC allows C or C++ developers to add another function
that responds to additional integer messages by calling developer-defined functions
corresponding to those integers.
@ref MpiWorker calls the callback function when the message number
is not one of the PhreeqcRM message numbers.
Messages are unique integer numbers. PhreeqcRM uses integers in a range
beginning at 0. It is suggested that developers use message numbers starting
at 1000 or higher for their tasks.
The callback function calls a developer-defined function specified
by the message number and then returns to @ref MpiWorker to wait for
another message.
@n@n
In C and C++, an additional pointer can be supplied to find the data necessary to do the task.
A void pointer may be set with @ref SetMpiWorkerCallbackCookie. This pointer
is passed to the callback function through a void pointer argument in addition
to the integer message argument. The pointer may be to a struct or class instance
that provides a number of additional pointers to data. @ref SetMpiWorkerCallbackCookie
must be called by each worker before @ref MpiWorker is called.
@n@n
The motivation for this method is to allow the workers to perform other
tasks, for instance, parallel transport calculations, within the structure
of @ref MpiWorker. The callback function
can be used to allow the workers to receive data, perform transport calculations,
and (or) send results, without leaving the loop of @ref MpiWorker. Alternatively,
it is possible for the workers to return from @ref MpiWorker
by a call to @ref MpiWorkerBreak by root. The workers could then call
subroutines to receive data, calculate transport, and send data,
and then resume processing PhreeqcRM messages from root with another
call to @ref MpiWorker.

Sets the property for partitioning solids between the saturated and unsaturated

The option is intended to be used by saturated-only
flow codes that allow a variable water table.
The value has meaning only when saturations
less than 1.0 are encountered. The partially saturated cells

the water interacts with only half of the solids and gases; the other half is unreactive
until the water table rises. As the saturation in a cell varies,
solids and gases are transferred between the

Set the representative volume of each reaction cell.
By default the representative volume of each reaction cell is 1 liter.
The volume of water in a reaction cell is determined by the procuct of the representative volume,
the porosity (@ref SetPorosity), and the saturation (@ref SetSaturation).
The numerical method of PHREEQC is more robust if the water volume for a reaction cell is
within a couple orders of magnitude of 1.0.
Small water volumes caused by small porosities and (or) small saturations (and (or) small representative volumes)
may cause non-convergence of the numerical method.
In these cases, a larger representative volume may help. Note
that increasing the representative volume also increases
the number of moles of the reactants in the reaction cell (minerals, surfaces, exchangers,
and others), which are defined as moles per representative volume.

(@ref SetDensity) and
multiplied by the solution volume.

To convert from moles
of element in the representative volume of a reaction cell to mg/L, the number of moles of an element is divided by the

based on the vector of surface species concentrations (@a species_conc).
This method is intended for use with multicomponent-diffusion transport calculations,
and @ref SetSpeciesSaveOn must be set to @a true.
The list of surface species is determined by @ref FindComponents and includes all
surfaces species that can be made from the set of components.
The method determines the total concentration of a component
by summing the molarities of the individual species times the stoichiometric
coefficient of the element in each species.
Surface compositions in the reaction cells are updated with these component concentrations.

@param species_conc     Vector of surface species concentrations. Dimension of the array is @a nspecies times @a nxyz,
where  @a nspecies is the number of surface species (@ref GetSpeciesCount),
and @a nxyz is the number of user grid cells (@ref GetGridCellCount).
Concentrations are moles per m2.
@retval IRM_RESULT      0 is success, negative is failure (See @ref DecodeError).
@see                    @ref FindComponents, @ref GetSurfaceSpeciesConcentrations, @ref GetSurfaceSpeciesCount,
@ref GetSurfaceSpeciesNames, @ref GetSpeciesSaveOn, @ref SetSpeciesSaveOn.

/**
Determines the volume and density to use when converting from the reaction-cell concentrations
to transport concentrations (@ref GetConcentrations).
Two options are available to convert concentration units:
(1) the density and solution volume calculated by PHREEQC are used, or
(2) the specified density (@ref SetDensity)
and solution volume are determined by the product of
saturation (@ref SetSaturation), porosity (@ref SetPorosity),
and representative volume (@ref SetRepresentativeVolume).
Transport models that consider density-dependent flow will probably use the
PHREEQC-calculated density and solution volume (default),
whereas transport models that assume constant-density flow will probably use
specified values of density and solution volume.
Only the following databases distributed with PhreeqcRM have molar-volume information
needed to accurately calculate density and solution volume: phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat.
Density is only used when converting to or from transport units of mass fraction.

@param tf          @a True indicates that the solution density and volume as
calculated by PHREEQC will be used to calculate concentrations.
@a False indicates that the solution density set by @ref SetDensity and the volume determined by the
product of  @ref SetSaturation, @ref SetPorosity, and @ref SetRepresentativeVolume,
will be used to calculate concentrations retrieved by @ref GetConcentrations.
@see                    @ref GetConcentrations,  @ref SetDensity,
@ref SetPorosity, @ref SetRepresentativeVolume, @ref SetSaturation.
